OOP?:{
 1. Inheritence
 2. Encapsulation
 3. Polymorphism
 4. Abstraction
}

Inheritence?:{
  like real life, inheritence lets classes inherit attributes(variables) and functions from parent classes to avoid having to redefine and allow reusability and extending the function of classes
}

Encapsulation:?{
  the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse
}

Polymorphism:?{
  one interface, many methods. which means it is possible to define a general use/simple interface that can be used by multiple classes that each apply it to their specific situation
}

Abstraction:?{
  simplifying complex systems by hiding the details and exposing the necessary functions
}
